# SuessR
An R package for calculating and applying Suess and Laws corrections to stable carbon isotope data.

Background:

The Suess and Laws corrections calculated by SuessR account for the changing baseline in global atmospheric and oceanic stable carbon isotope values resulting from the burning of fossil fuels since Industrial Revolution. The Suess correction deals directly with the changing stable carbon isotope ratios of the oceans, and ultimately of the dissolved inorganic carbon available to photosynthesizers. The Laws correction addresses changes in fractionation of stable carbon isotopes by phytoplankton, and is impacted by factors including aqueous CO2 concentrations, cell size, phytoplankton growth rates, and more.
