Title: Suess and Laws Corrections to Stable Carbon Isotope Data
Description: The SuessR package generates region-specific Suess and Laws corrections for
    Î´13C data from marine organisms collected between 1850 and 2019. Version 0.1.0 of 
    the package contains three built-in regions: the Bering Sea ('Bering'), the
    Aleutian archipelago ('Aleutians'), and the Gulf of Alaska ('Gulf of Alaska'). 
    Users can supply environmental data for regions currently not built into the 
    package to generate corrections for those regions.
